## Project Description
BlaBlaCar is a ridesharing platform that connects drivers with empty seats to
passengers looking for seats.
Matching drivers and passengers is a strategic goal for BlaBlaCar. Members are
more likely to continue using the service if they always find a ride to share. Overall,
matching enhances user experience as it helps people to travel and make new
connections.
Passengers would typically browse rides created by drivers on their desktop or
mobile and select their preferred option to travel. Drivers are offering their empty
seats via a publication funnel, whereby they set up the details of their rides
(destination, date, time, number of seats, price, etc.). BlaBlaCar suggests a price
during the publication to help drivers. It is not mandatory to follow the recommended
price for drivers.

- Based on my analysis of the dataset, I will explain what factors
influence success (whether a driver will travel alone or with at least one
passenger).
- I will Build a prediction model for success.As if My model would be deployed in production and therefore it should reach best compromise between precision and speed of predictions.
- I will Suggest several applications or product features that could use your modelâ€™s output.

This report is organised as follows:

 **1. Data Analysis/ Visualisation**
 - folium heatmap
 - histogram (balance)
 - correlation and feature importance
   
**2. Feature Engineering**
 - Extracting features from dates, latitudes longitudes
 - create the target: Success

**3. Build a prediction model for success**
 - Try several models ( Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGboost, LightGBM, Neural Network)
 -Compare them with several metrics(Accuracy, F1score, Time...)

**4. Bonus**
- From Lat and Long to Geohash
